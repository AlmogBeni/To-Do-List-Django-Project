# To-Do-List-Django-Project

This is my first project as a full-stack Python developer.
This project was made to really understand the logic thinking behind the code, and practicing it.
Back-end technology :
- Django (v3.2.4)

Front-end technology's:
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap

I would love to hear you'r opinions on the project!
Any suggestions will be more then welcome :)
